  <h1>Storyboarding</h1>
  <p>I created two storyboards to explain the interaction between a potential user and my interface. When Esther reviewed my first storyboard, she had a lot of questions about the visual interface itself rather than how the user would interact with it. Her feedback helped me realize that I hadnâ€™t focused a lot on what the screen would actually look like on my final project. In my second storyboard, I chose to emphasize the different interactions of the visual interface, and only included one panel that portrayed the user breathing in and out of the headset microphone. This version proved to help Shelby better understand the context and details of my concept, and this allowed her to provide helpful suggestions about insights about some of the details of the interface.
