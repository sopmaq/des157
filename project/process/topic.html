    <h1>Topic Brainstorm</h1>
    <p class="subhead">Sophie Maquiling - ISEA 2017</p>
    
    <h2>1. Physical responses to mental and emotional states</h2>
    <p class="topic">Biocreation and data</p>
    <p>People experiencing anxiety are often told to notice their breathing patterns and practice techniques to slow down their heart rate and number of breaths. By noticing and changing something physical, they may be able to alleviate a related mental or emotional state. <br /><br />How can noticing and then interacting with our phsyical behaviors help us overcome a negative mental experience? I'd like to design something that collects data from an individual's physical behaviors that this individual can interact with to better understand their current mental/emotional state.</p>
    
    <br /><br />
    
    <h2>2. Balikbayan (and other forms of overseas communication)</h2>
    <p class="topic">Media art, landscape, and heritage</p>
    <p>"Balikbayan" refers to the custom of immigrants and overseas workers sending household items and food purchased abroad back to the Philippines. I'd like to explore different ways that immigrants and their descendants communicate with their "home-country/countries" by creating some form of visualization or media representation.<br /><br />With this piece of media art, I'd like to encourage a conversation about the differences between first and second/third/etc. generation immigrants as well as what differences exist in the preservation, alteration, or disintegration of an individual's heritage.</p>
    <br /><br />
    
    <h2>3. Making education more accessible</h2>
    <p class="topic">Interdisciplinary platforms for coexistance</p>
    <p>How can technology help make quality education more accessible for students from disadvantaged backgrounds? Some ideas: interactive guide that helps potential first-generation college applicants understand the process of applying to college, academic resources that help elementary, high school, and college students who are learning English, mentorship aided by technology, interactive visualization that informs the public about the inequalities that exist when trying to obtain quality education in the US.</p>
