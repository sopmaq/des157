<h1>How will your users understand the content of the project?</h1>
<p>When I talked to members of the Biomedical Engineering Society, they suggested that I show users an image, text, or video while they breathe in to the microphone so that the users don't become conscious of their breathing. In an effort to distract the user, I think that several seconds of changing images or text would help provide context about the interface.</p>
<h1>How will your users understand the primary objectives?</h1>
<p>The introductory images/text above would serve to help users understand the objectives of the interface as well. I'd also like to include a hidden menu where users can find more information about the interface.</p>
<h1>What content and features do your users need, and in what form do they need it?</h1>
<p>The user will need a main visualization that corresponds to their breathing patterns. I plan to create this using the p5.js library similar to the draft I made in Studio 5. Supplementary to this main visualization are instructions and background information in the form of moving text/images at a "tutorial" stage, as mentioned above. I'd also like to include a hidden menu that, when expanded, includes more information about the interface.</p>
<h1>How do your users think your interactive projects should work and what are
their experience levels with the type of media you are creating?</h1>
<p>A major roadblock to my project is accessability. In my Studio 5 project, the user's breathing interacted with the shapes on the screen by breathing into an iPhone headset. Not every user will have access to an iPhone headset or know that the headset actually has a microphone, soI'd like to work on finding a way to read in breathing data without an iPhone headset. <br /><br />
Because anxiety persists in all age groups, not all age groups will understand the purpose of visualization.</p>
