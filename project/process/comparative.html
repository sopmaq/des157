    <h3>Interaction Design</h3>

    <br /><br />
    <p>exHALeR allows users to customize their breathing exercise with different options. It's important to note that the application opens on the breathing application in use, and that these extraneous options are only available when the user choses to open up the options menu on the top right. This indicates that the application keeps those experiencing anxiety in mind, as the number of options may be overwhelming if the application opened with them on the start.</p>
    <h3>Overall Experience</h3>
    <p>Overall, eXHALer achieves a great level of effectiveness while its usage and visual style remain simple. </p>
