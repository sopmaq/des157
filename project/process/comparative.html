    </h1></center>
    <p><a href="xhaler.com" target="_blank">eXHALeR</a> is a browser application that guides people in breathing exercises.The app is geared towards people practicing yoga or meditation, as well as those suffering anxiety or panic attacks.</p>
    
    
    
    <h3>Interface Design</h3>

    <br /><br />
    <p>The application has a simple design with a color palette of muted blues and purples. Such a palette is evocative of feelings of peace and serenity, which is appropriate for users wishing to relieve anxiety or practice yoga or meditation. </p>
    
    
    <h3>Interaction Design</h3>

    <br /><br />
    <p>exHALeR allows users to customize their breathing exercise with different options. It's important to note that the application opens on the breathing application in use, and that these extraneous options are only available when the user choses to open up the options menu on the top right. This indicates that the application keeps those experiencing anxiety in mind, as the number of options may be overwhelming if the application opened with them on the start.</p>
    <h3>Overall Experience</h3>
    <p>Overall, eXHALer achieves a great level of effectiveness while its usage and visual style remain simple. The color palette and features compare sharply to the mobile application below, which is a brainwave visualizer rather than a breathing visualizer.</p>

    <center><h1>NeuroSky MindWave Mobile - Brainwave Visualizer</h1></center></article>
    <p>NeuroSky MindWave Mobile is an EEG device . This is an <a href="http://store.neurosky.com/products/brainwave-visualizer-android">Android application</a> that visualizes the data read in from the MindWave Mobile.</p>

    <h3>Interface Design</h3>
    
    <p>The application involves many contrasting colors. Each color maps to a certain category of data, and together create the form on the left. Though this contrast allows to compare differences in brainwave activity, it is also stark and may be difficult for those experiencing anxiety to use.</p>
    <h3>Interaction Design</h3>
    <p>Though I am unable to experience this application myself, I believe one would wear the NeuroSky MindWave and then look at then watch the visualization change.</p>
    <h3>Overall Experience</h3>
    <p>The user of this visualizer would probably not be someone experiencing anxiety or a panic attack. Though the visualized form on the left makes brainwave movements tangible, I would want to connect this information with other physical sensations like heartbeat and breathing. I would also change the color palette to a calmer, more soothing one.</p>
