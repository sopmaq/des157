  <p>I received a lot of good feedback from David and Spencer. David surprised me when he mentioned that using the microphone felt "silly," but in a way that made him feel like he was in a relaxed environment. It was interesting watching David and Spencer play with the microphone as five minutes went by, and they both approached the microphone playfully and curiously - which may or may not be representative of someone under stress or experiencing anxiety.

    <br /><br />Some of the changes to the visualization and design that I plan on making to my final are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><p>Start the screen off with instructions</p></li>
      <li><p>Change the typography to something "more soothing" and less "geometric and rigid"</p></li>
    </ul>

    <p>
    <br /><br />Some of the technical changes I plan on making to my final are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><p>Make the canvas responsive and span the width of the entire page</p></li>
      <li><p>Create an option to toggle the breathing exercise on and off</p></li>
      <li><p>Incorporate randomization for the visualization</p></li>
    </ul>
