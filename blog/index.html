      <h2>Venmo - online payment form</h2>
      <p class="blog-date">JANUARY 31, 2017</p>
      <p>

        <br />
        Venmo is a mobile and browser application that allows users to send money to friends and family online. I based the analysis below on the major form themes discussed in Bill DeRouchey's <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/billder/learning-ixd-from-everyday-objects">"Learning IxD From Everyday Objects"</a>
        <br /><br />
        <strong>Hierarchy</strong><br />
        The information on the top are the recipient name, format for filling out the value field, and "Pay" and "Charge" buttons. These three elements are seen before the buttons on the bottom. Of these three, the value field has the highest contrast, which made it the first thing I saw. This hierarchy is appropriate, but may benefit with a change to the "Pay" and "Charge" buttons that are of lower contrast (see below).
        <br /><br /><strong>Clarity</strong><br />Clear, actionable words ("Pay", "Charge", "Send", "Type to...") make minimize my guesswork and expectations for the form. One part of the form that confused me was pressing "Pay" and "Charge". I typed the person's name first, moved to what I saw next, the field for entering value of money, and was about to press "send" before realizing I had to choose between "Pay" and "Charge". Though the actions are clear, the order in which they should be completed - whether important or not - is still vague.
        <br /><br /><strong>Purpose</strong><br />
        <p>The purpose of the fields on the form are clear, as I expected to fill out this information due to my background knowledge of Venmo's context(sending or receiving money). The color change on the "Send"/"Charge" button tells me that this is the most important or final button to press.

        <h2>Evaluating my E-Deposit App</h2>
        <p class="blog-date">JANUARY 12, 2017
        </p>

        <p>
            I live in Davis, but my credit union only has branches located in Southern California. Because my paychecks come in the form of physical checks, I have to "e-deposit" them using my credit union's mobile application.</p>
            <br /><br />
                <div id="screenshot-article-1">
                <img id ="fcu_1" class="screenshot" src="images/fcu_1.gif" alt="Screenshot of e-deposit app">
                <img class="screenshot" src="images/fcu_2.gif" alt="Screenshot of e-deposit app with submit button">
                </div>

            <br /><br />
            <p>
            The interface of the mobile application is simple, as it contains a limited color palette of neutral blues and grays over a solid white background. The application's design is strong when considering general ease of reading and navigation.
            <br /><br />
            Although visually strong, there are aspects to the mobile app that make information unclear. Although I rarely make a mistake when inputting information about each check, one hindrance to usability is that after I deposit a check, I'm left with two button options: "Deposit" and "Done" (not pictured). Both mean the same to me - I want to deposit my check, and I'm done inputting the information. After trial and error, I learned that "Deposit" means "Deposit another check".
            <br /><br />
            I often feel unsatisfied after I deposit a check because the ambiguity of terms and time it takes for the check to actually process makes me feel like I've made a mistake somewhere.
