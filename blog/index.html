  <h2>Chapter 6: Street Signs and Breadcrumbs</h2>
  <p class="blog-date">MARCH 7, 2017</p>
  <a href="ch6.pptx" target="_blank">Click here to download our presentation</a>
  <p>Krug opens up Chapter 6 by comparing visiting a website to look for some particular information to being sent to a store to find a specific object. Some people go to a store and ask an employee to help them find something, and others use wayfinding cues to browse through the store. User behaviors, like seeking help or browsing, and the conventions used to help people navigate large department or grocery stores, such as aisle labels and hanging product lists, are similar to user behaviors and best practices of good website design.
    <br /><br />Krug identifies several navigation conventions that are considered standard among contemporary website design. A major best practice in good navigation to frame the website using a section called the primary navigation. The primary navigation typically includes the following: a Site ID, Sections, Utilities, Search. The Site ID includes a logo or wordmark and serves to help the user quickly identify which website they are on. The Sections of the website are usually presented as a list of links in the primary navigation, similar to aisle signs in a grocery stores, which helps users who are browsing for content narrow down their options. The Search provides an alternative to browsing, and caters to users who have entered the website knowing what they are looking for. The Utilities include other important user interactions, such as a Sign-In or Shopping Cart.
    <br /><br />Breadcrumbs are a type of secondary navigation that helps users identify their location in the website. Some of the best strategies while using breadcrumbs is to have them at the top of the page, use “>” between levels and bold the last item. It helps users trace back their path to the original landing point. It is a very useful design strategy to organize data especially in websites like amazon.com or homedepot, which are heavy in content.
    <br /><br />The author discusses his admiration for tabs in chapter 6. He finds them self-evident, hard to miss and slick. However, we consider tabs are not the best strategy that works with contemporary website design guidelines. They serve to unsystematic, and often distract the users from their task. They also make the website look dense in design, which could be avoided by using process bars and breadcrumbs.
    <br /><br />Good website navigation typically incorporates conventions such as primary navigation and breadcrumbs. Not all of these best practices need to be followed to an exact standard – good navigation is based on the individual needs of a particular website. According to Krug’s “Trunk Test,” website navigation is good when a user is able to understand both the local and global navigational structure in the least amount of time possible.

  <h2>Studio 5 - p5.js-sound</h2>

    I originally started working with Paper.js to create shapes that users could modify. To better align with the ISEA sub-theme (Bio-Creation and Data), I realized that built-in microphones on computers, phones, and handsets could be used as valuable tools for reading in biological data. I shifted my project to work with the <a href=“https://p5js.org/reference/#/libraries/p5.sound” target="_blank">p5.js-sound</a> library and created an interface where users’ breaths interact with shapes.
    <br /><br />
The library itself is useful for visualizations, as p5.js-sound is an extension of p5.js. I found working with the shapes fairly intuitive, and created a range of shapes to better experiment with the library’s functionality.
<br /><br />
I spoke to members of the Biomedical Engineering Society to ask them if they had any advice on estimating respiratory rate read in from a microphone. If I am able to define a “breath” (when working with p5.js, I defined a “breath” as when the amplitude object shifts from 0.0 to 1.0 and back to 0.0), I can count them for 15 seconds then multiply by 4. Some suggested that I present an image or text on the screen while reading in breaths from users to minimize the amount that a user is conscious of their breathing.

    For Studio 4 "Time is on My Side," I created a simple interface that changes background color according to the time of day.
    <img src="images/skypalette.gif" alt="sky color palette"><br />
    <strong>Date()</strong><br />
     Using the Date() Javascript object, I created a switch statement that changes the background color every hour to one that mimics the color of the sky during that time.
     <br /><br />
     <strong>Tooltips</strong><br />
     Using the setTimeout() function to create timed events, I used three tooltips to describe what I am doing at a given moment during the day.
     <br /><br />
     <strong>Clock</strong><br />
     I created a clock that counts in real time by creating a recursive function using the Date() object.

  <h2>Studio 3 Usability</h2>
  <p class="blog-date">FEBRUARY 7, 2017</p>
  <p>
    <a href="https://sopmaq.github.io/des157/studio3" target="_blank">Click here to view Studio 3</a><br /><br />
    <img src="images/studio3_main.gif" alt="First view of studio3"><br />
    <strong>Pen Interaction</strong><br />The only action a user can take on the home page is moving the cursor over the group of pens. When the user does this, they find that a pen will move down in response to their cursor hovering over it. I wanted to encourage users to explore the page by providing little explanation about the row of pens and instead allow the user to figure it out themselves by playing around with their mouse on the screen.<br /><br />
    <img src="images/studio3_mouse.gif" alt="How each pen indicates movement"><br />
    <strong>Popup Display</strong><br />
    When a user hovers over a pen, the cursor changes to an index pointer. This indicates that the user can click the pen. Upon clicking a pen, a Popup Display appears giving more information about the brand, model, and personal facts about each pen. The user can hover over the circle X to see another index pointer, indicating that they can close the Popup.<br /><br />
    <img src="images/studio3_second.gif" alt="View of studio3 after pen is pressed"><br />
    <strong>Removing Extraneous Details</strong><br />
    When first designing this page, I kept the header "There's a fine line..." at the top. I noticed that it obstructed much of the space that the Popup Display was using, and it didn't provide any additional information about the pens. I chose to hide the header when users clicked on a pen to learn more about it as they would be more interested in information about the pen rather than information about the page.

      <h2>Venmo - online payment form</h2>
      <p class="blog-date">JANUARY 31, 2017</p>
      <p>
        <img src="images/venmo.gif" alt="Venmo desktop interface"><br />
        <br />
        Venmo is a mobile and browser application that allows users to send money to friends and family online. I based the analysis below on the major form themes discussed in Bill DeRouchey's <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/billder/learning-ixd-from-everyday-objects">"Learning IxD From Everyday Objects"</a>
        <br /><br />
        <strong>Hierarchy</strong><br />
        The information on the top are the recipient name, format for filling out the value field, and "Pay" and "Charge" buttons. These three elements are seen before the buttons on the bottom. Of these three, the value field has the highest contrast, which made it the first thing I saw. This hierarchy is appropriate, but may benefit with a change to the "Pay" and "Charge" buttons that are of lower contrast (see below).
        <br /><br /><strong>Clarity</strong><br />Clear, actionable words ("Pay", "Charge", "Send", "Type to...") make minimize my guesswork and expectations for the form. One part of the form that confused me was pressing "Pay" and "Charge". I typed the person's name first, moved to what I saw next, the field for entering value of money, and was about to press "send" before realizing I had to choose between "Pay" and "Charge". Though the actions are clear, the order in which they should be completed - whether important or not - is still vague.
        <br /><br /><strong>Purpose</strong><br />
        <p>The purpose of the fields on the form are clear, as I expected to fill out this information due to my background knowledge of Venmo's context(sending or receiving money). The color change on the "Send"/"Charge" button tells me that this is the most important or final button to press.

        <h2>Evaluating my E-Deposit App</h2>
        <p class="blog-date">JANUARY 12, 2017
        </p>

        <p>
            I live in Davis, but my credit union only has branches located in Southern California. Because my paychecks come in the form of physical checks, I have to "e-deposit" them using my credit union's mobile application.</p>
            <br /><br />
                <div id="screenshot-article-1">
                <img id ="fcu_1" class="screenshot" src="images/fcu_1.gif" alt="Screenshot of e-deposit app">
                <img class="screenshot" src="images/fcu_2.gif" alt="Screenshot of e-deposit app with submit button">
                </div>

            <br /><br />
            <p>
            The interface of the mobile application is simple, as it contains a limited color palette of neutral blues and grays over a solid white background. The application's design is strong when considering general ease of reading and navigation.
            <br /><br />
            Although visually strong, there are aspects to the mobile app that make information unclear. Although I rarely make a mistake when inputting information about each check, one hindrance to usability is that after I deposit a check, I'm left with two button options: "Deposit" and "Done" (not pictured). Both mean the same to me - I want to deposit my check, and I'm done inputting the information. After trial and error, I learned that "Deposit" means "Deposit another check".
            <br /><br />
            I often feel unsatisfied after I deposit a check because the ambiguity of terms and time it takes for the check to actually process makes me feel like I've made a mistake somewhere.
